The Sony PlayStation 3 controller, which is officially known as Sixaxis Wireless Controller, is a control device designed for the PlayStation 3 console.
This device implements wireless technology, so you will be able to use it without any cable. It can be used with a cable for charging the battery or playing while the controller charges.
Another new characteristic are the movement sensors. These are a system which allows the game to respond to different movements of the controller. 
The vibration system is another technology implemented for this generation of controllers. It adds another layer of complexity to create amazing and immersive experiences for the user.
