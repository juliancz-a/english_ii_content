| Defining and non-defining relative clauses<br><br>Frase verbal => clause<br><br>- We use defining relative clauses to give essential information about someone or something. It usually comes immediately after the noun it describes. We don’t use commas to mark its beginning or end.<br>    <br><br>She is the woman who I met with yesterday.<br><br>- We often leave out the relative pronoun when it is the object of the verb:<br>    <br><br>They’re the people (that/who) she met at Jon’s office.<br><br>Here are some bugs (that/which) the developer has identified.<br> |

| <br>- We use non-defining relative clauses to give extra information about the person or thing. It is not necessary information. We don’t need it to understand who or what is being referred to. We use commas to mark the beginning and end of  the non-defining relative clause. We can’t use the relative pronoun ‘that’ to introduce a non-defining relative clause.<br>    <br>Clare, who I work with, is in charge of the project.                                                                                                                                             |
