#### **NOUNS**

**Gerunds** 
	A gerund is a word that is formed by a verb + -ing suffix used in a place where we traditionally would find a noun.
	They can be the **subject or object of a sentence** or they can be found **after a preposition**.
		( **Designers start a project by making a wireframe.**)
	**Prepositions***
	 Are words that connect nouns, pronouns, and phrases to other words in a sentence, showing relationships like time, location, or direction. Common examples include "in," "on," "at," "with," "to," and "from,".
	 
Some verbs are always followed by gerunds (e.g. avoid, fancy, finish, give up, hate, imagine, involve, keep, look forward to, mind, suggest, enjoy, love, etc)
